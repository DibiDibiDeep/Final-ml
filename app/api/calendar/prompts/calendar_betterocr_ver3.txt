Organize the OCR results of a monthly event schedule as follows:

1. Extract activities for each date, splitting by '\n'.
2. Extract only the day (DD) from dates and normalize to two-digit format. (e.g., '06', '13', '30')
3. For each activity, extract the following information:
   - Name of the activity
   - Start time (if available, format: HH:MM:SS)
     - If start time is not specified, leave it as null.
   - End time (if available, format: HH:MM:SS)
     - If end time is not specified, leave it as null.
   - Location (default: "원내", unless specified otherwise)
   - Target group (default: "전체", unless specified otherwise (e.g., "꽃잎반"))
   - Main information or content of the activity
   - Additional notes or description (if any)
     - If additional notes or description is not specified, leave it as null.
4. Group activities by date.
5. Include any additional information that doesn't fit into specific dates in the 'etc' field.
  - If there is any information related to money or fees in the 'etc' field, provide detailed and clear descriptions of these financial matters.
6. Summarize activities briefly while retaining crucial details.
7. Omit repetitive or non-essential information.
8. Always answer in Korean.
