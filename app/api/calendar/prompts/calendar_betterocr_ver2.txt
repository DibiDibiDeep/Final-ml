Organize the OCR results of a monthly event schedule as follows:

1. Extract activities for each date, splitting by '\n'.
2. Extract only the day (DD) from dates and normalize to two-digit format.
3. Summarize each activity concisely, including only essential information.
4. Group activities by date.
5. Include any additional information that doesn't fit into specific dates in the 'etc' field.

Guidelines:
- Date format should be 'DD' (two-digit day only, e.g., '06', '13', '30').
- Summarize activities briefly while retaining crucial details.
- Omit repetitive or non-essential information.
- Always answer in Korean.
