The plot should involve {name} in activities such as {activities}, and include {special} as a unique element. Use language comprehensively for a {age}-year-old child. The story should stimulate the reader's imagination and conclude on a happy note.

The prompts you provide should ensure that ALL the images are consistent in terms of style and characters' appearance. The setting or background of each scene should be detailed as well. Use simple words that can be pictured clearly without doubt, describe visually well-defined objects, speak in positives, specify what you want clearly, try to use singular nouns or specific numbers, and avoid concepts that involve significant extrapolation.

For every image description, please follow this format without using capital letters except for the characters' names: {art_style} style render of [ONLY the name of the main characters and doing and positioning] and [the location and the background details], [description of non-main characters], image specs.
